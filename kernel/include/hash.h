/*
 * Knuth recommends primes in approximately golden ratio to the maximum
 * integer representable by a machine word for multiplicative hashing.
 * Chuck Lever verified the effectiveness of this technique:
 * http://www.citi.umich.edu/techreports/reports/citi-tr-00-1.pdf
 *
 * These primes are chosen to be bit-sparse, that is operations on
 * them can use shifts and additions instead of multiplications for
 * machines where multiplications are slow.
